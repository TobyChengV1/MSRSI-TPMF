# MSRSI-TPMF
A Tie Points Matching Framework of Multi - Source Remote Sensing Images(MSRSI-TPMF)

This study proposes a Tie Points (TPs) Matching Framework of Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images (MSRSI-TPMF) based on the geometric and radiation characteristics of Remote Sensing Imagery. First, RSI is divided into different grids and undergo local geometry correction. Next, matching between slice images is performed by different Matching algorithms(MAs). Finally, Tie Points(TPs) are generated by mapping matched points in multiple slice images to the whole RSI using a geometric processing model.  
As an optional, block adjustment mismatched point elimination (BAMPE)method can be used for mismatched point elimination.
